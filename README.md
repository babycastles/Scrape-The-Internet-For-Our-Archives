# Scrape the web because you're bad at documentation :)

Since 2010, [Babycastles](http://babycastles.com) has been throwing great events and doing a bad job documenting them. It's hard to describe what we do without photos and videos so I'm documenting the tools and process I use to scrape social media sites for photos of our events. 

I'm writing these using a Mac, if it's different for a PC/Linux - sorry. Hope this helps other people too.

Also, we're a 9 year old 501c3 non-profit run by volunteers. If you like what we do, including this, please consider making a [tax-deductable donation](https://babycastles.com/Information) so we can keep doing it!

*this doesnâ€™t seem to work yet but it was [just released](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader/pull/212) 5 hours before I tried it so maybe it still has some bugs to work out. i'm on 4.1.1, try `pip install --upgrade instaloader later`*
`instaloader --login=babycastles "%271251592" --filename-pattern={date_utc}_UTC_{profile}`
6. After you download everything once, you can just append `--fast-update` and it will only download the latest posts since the last time you ran the query
